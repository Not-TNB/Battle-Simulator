# INTRO
Welcome to Not_TNB and DaKawaliKid's Battle Simulator, a really scuffed battle simulator (obviously) full of random chances and no skill to be found

# VERSIONS
## V1.0
Overhaul of BETA by DaKawaliKid. Introduced:
- Heavy attacks which inflict a higher damage
- Concept of suicide where fighters are able to kill themselves (inspired through an oversight in BETA where a fighter had the chance to terget themselves)
- Cataclysmic 'world events' which affect a large amount of fighters
- The ability for fighters to interact with other fighters without harm to increase realism
- Death messages at the end of certain attacks to distinguish deaths and kills from fighter interactions
- The ability for fighters to find and use items that affect their core stats and other effects

## BETA
Original version created by Not_TNB. Introduced:
- Concept of 'fighters' with random stats and user-inputted names
- Core fighters stats: HP, ATK, DEF, CRIT DAMAGE (CD), CRIT CHANCE (CR)
- Turn based 'combat' involving random attacks and combos by one fighter onto another whose damage and result is determined by random chance and core stats
