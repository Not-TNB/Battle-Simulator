# INTRO ‚öîÔ∏è
Welcome to Not_TNB and DaKawaliKid's Text-Based Battle Simulator, a 100% not scuffed "last-one-standing" battle simulator (definitely) full of random chances and no skill to be found. Currently we are on **VERSION 1.5**, and are working on the next update, **VERSION 2.0**

# HOW 2 PLAY üéÆ
(Example images are at the bottom of this file)
1. Download the file named `[latest version].exe`
2. Run the file. This should open up a shell with a prompt, where you can enter the names of "fighters" (who will have random stats and experience random events and interactions). You have to input the fighter names seperated by "`, `", although fighter names are allowed to have spaces:<br>
  ‚ùå Fighter 1,Fighter 2,Fighter 3<br>
  ‚ùå Red Green Blue<br>
  ‚ùå A ,B ,C<br>
  ‚úÖ Python, Javascript, C++<br>
  ‚úÖ Mike Oxlong, Joe Mama, Ben Dover<br>
3. Click <kbd>Enter</kbd> to progress 1 turn, and read the events that occur. Each turn consists of a list of events and interactions, followed by fighter statistics (such as HP, kills, etc.). When there is 1 fighter left, that fighter is announced the winner

# MAJOR VERSIONS üöÄ
## V1.0
Overhaul of BETA by DaKawaliKid. Introduced:
- Heavy attacks which inflict increased damage
- Concept of suicide where fighters are able to kill themselves (inspired through an oversight in BETA where a fighter had the chance to target themselves)
- Cataclysmic 'world events' which affect a large amount of fighters
- The ability for fighters to interact with other fighters without harm to increase realism
- Death messages at the end of certain attacks to distinguish deaths and kills from fighter interactions
- The ability for fighters to find and use items that affect their core stats and other effects, categorized into weapons, armor and miscellaneous (which usually have no effect)

## V0.0 (BETA)
Original version created by Not_TNB. Introduced:
- Concept of 'fighters' with random stats and user-inputted names
- Core fighters stats: HP, ATK, DEF, CRIT DAMAGE (CD), CRIT CHANCE (CR)
- Turn based 'combat' involving random attacks, combos and blocks by one fighter onto another whose damage and result is determined by random chance and core stats
